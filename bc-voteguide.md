# YIP Voting Guide

> The following is the opinion of the wiki manager and community member Brandon Curtis
{.is-info}

It's your choice whether and how to vote, but I believe that the following proposals offer the best chance of a successful v3 launch. Please feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bcmakes) or [Discord](/team).

## [YIP-17: Improved LP Incentives][yip17]

This proposal incentivizes YAM liquidity providers over a longer period of time while avoiding overpaying for liquidity in the first weeks after launch. It does not change the total incentives paid to Uniswap LPs; it only modifies the distribution schedule to start at a lower level and decrease at a slower rate. ([discussion][yip17-forum])

## [YIP-19: Migration Vesting][yip19]

This proposal encourages price appreciation upon v3 launch by vesting part of the supply that is migrated, awarded, or paid out as incentives. ([discussion][yip19-forum])

## [YIP-22: YAM FAM Migration Rescue Fund][yip22]

This proposal sets aside funds to pay out claims to users who missed or botched the migration to YAMv2. This is a small group—less than 1.5% of supply missed the migration—and the cost is worth the good press and opportunity to invite earlier holders back into the project. ([discussion][yip22-forum])

## [YIP-15: Delegator Reward Modification][yip15] (vote AGAINST)

This is an excessive payout to large holders that executed a single transaction in an effort to save YAMv1. The effort reached its vote goals but was unsuccessful due to a technical failure.  This proposal doubles the balance of these addresses, which suffered few if any opportunity cost for taking this action, and dilutes all other holders while diverting 16% of the funds intended for liquidity incentives (3.3% of total supply).  Vote to REJECT this proposal.  In case YIP-15, does pass, also vote FOR the [YIP-15 amendment][yip15-amend] to shift some of the excessive payout to smaller holders. ([discussion][yip15-forum])

## [YIP-16: End of V2 and Audit Finalization][yip16]

This proposal ends the current proposal process and approves an audit for YAMv3. ([discussion][yip16-forum])
