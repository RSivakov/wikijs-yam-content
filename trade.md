## YAMv1 Uniswap LP Warnings

> Providing liquidity on Uniswap is for advanced users. You may lose funds! Understand the risks before attempting!
{.is-warning}

There were concerns that a problem in the [YAMv1 rebasing contract](/rebase) could cause issues for liquidity providers (LPs) in the YAM:yCRV Uniswap pool (YAM-yDAI+yUSDC+yUSDT+yTUSD Pair) if YAMv1 underwent a positive rebase.  These concerns are no longer valid because positive rebasing is now broken.

Some pools were not recognized by the [YAMv1 rebaser contract](/rebase), and therefore LPs providing liquidity in these pools were NOT guaranteed to receive their share of positive rebases.  This includes the [YAMv1-ETH pool](https://uniswap.info/pair/0xc358001a71b3160b4b243d6e8c6f52579f82215e).  However, positive rebasing is now broken and this is no longer a concern.
